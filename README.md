* MIT app Inventor 
* Chart Maker
* Google Chrome

#### APIs used
* Google Sheets
* Scripting

#### Techniques used to implement version control
With version control software such as Git, version control is much smoother and easier for us to implement. Using an online platform like Github to store our files means that we have an online back up of our work, which is beneficial for us collaborators.

1) Commit
- Once we saved our files, we commit them - the changes we made to our files in our repository will be saved as a version of the repository, and then our changes are now ready to go up on GitHub.
2) Pull
- Before we make any changes in GitHub, we pull - we made sure that we are completely up to date with the latest version of the online version of the files 
3) Push
- Once we are up to date, we push our changes - at this point our local copy and the online copy of the files will be the same.
